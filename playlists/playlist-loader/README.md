# Playlist loader config

Copy the playLists.txt to kodi/userdata/addon_data/plugin.video.playlistLoader

Edit the file to remove links to any channels you dont want

The playLists.txt file links to i4atv playlist, 
i have also added kodiland playlists you can link to 

If you are using another stalker addon apart from i4atv and kodiland,
you will need to clone the playlists and do a search and replace for the addon name

search for plugin.video.i4atv 
and replace with the name of the addon you are using

eg search for plugin.video.i4atv 

and replace with plugin.video.stalkerclone

and then edit the playLists.txt and change the links

you can find the addon name by looking in your kodi/addons directory
